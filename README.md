## AI Experiment \(COOL\!\!\!\)


</div>

### Description

I made this today for a laugh, 4 snakes have to be the last snake squirming in a fight to the death. The fun bit is that you can change, save and load different AI settings to change the behaviour of the computer controlled snakes. 0,1 or 2 human players allowed. I also have a snake game with better graphics on the site. If you like this, please remember to come back and vote!
